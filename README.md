# Falcon Heavy is a reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. The Falcon Heavy (previously known as the Falcon 9 Heavy) is a variant of the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 rocket core with two additional Falcon 9 first stages as strap-on boosters. This increases the low Earth orbit (LEO) maximum payload to 63,800 kilograms (140,700 lb), compared to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 lb) for a Falcon 9 full thrust and 27,500 kilograms (60,600 lb) for the now-retired NASA Space Shuttle. The Falcon Heavy is the world's highest capacity rocket in operation as of February 6, 2018, superseding the Delta IV Heavy payload to LEO by a factor of more than two. The Falcon Heavy is able to deliver this mass only when it is fully expended; the maximum mass to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with first stage and side booster recovery is 8,000 kilograms (17,637 lb), compared to 5,500 kilograms (12,100 lb) for a recoverable Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space, including the Moon and Mars, although as of February 5, 2018, there are no longer plans to use Falcon Heavy for crewed missions; it will instead be devoted to payloads such as large satellites. SpaceX successfully launched the Falcon Heavy on February 6, 2018, at 3:45pm EST (20:45 UTC). The dummy payload on its maiden flight was SpaceX founder Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster and a spacesuit-wearing mannequin nicknamed Starman.
